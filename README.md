#### Ruiz-Capstone-Loan Approval Project

# A Model for Bank Loan Approval Analysis and Predictions

## Introuction
Banks have to make decisions everyday regarding to approve a customers loan or deny a loan. But how is this done? What are the main factors involved that decides who gets approved while others denied? I was in banking many years and hope to explore the answers with this project with the interesting analysis involved. The authors from 

## Abstract

This project will work with data from a csv file, that will be cleaned and analyzed. A model will be trained,tested, and deployed to make predictions for customer bank loan approvals.

## {Goals of this Research} 
The goal will be to analyze csv data for bank customers and develop a model to predict loan approvals.

## Dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/gauravduttakiit/risk-analytics-in-banking-financial-services-1/input 

## Project Steps: 1. select topic, 2. select data set, 3. clean data set, 4. convert or transform data if needed, 5. train and develop a model, evaluate the model, Update and Adjust as needed.
